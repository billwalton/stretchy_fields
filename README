StretchyFields was motivated by one of 37signals' blogs on the Blank Slate 
problem ( http://37signals.com/designexplore/Highrise_Edit_Contacts ).  In a 
nutshell, the problem can be pretty simply stated: don't run the user off by 
making their first impression one that overstates the amount of data they 
have to enter.

This is a first cut.  It's simple to use but has limitations.  The big 3 are: 

1) All the fields in the form need to be StretchyFields.  This is next on the 
    list.
2) Only one group per form is supported.  Multiple groups are next.  Nested 
     groups will be added as soon as someone says they need them, if not 
     sooner.
3) Only <input> tags are supported.  There's definitely a need for <textarea> 
    and <select> tag support and that will be next after multiple groups unless
    someone speaks up about wanting the priority changed.
    
There's a working index.html file included.  

Two attributes are required to turn an input into a StretchyField.
1) class="stretchy_input"
2) default_value = "text you want to show the user in blank slate form"

A third attribute is optional and controls the visual display of the fields.
3) required="required"
If this attribute exists, the field looks like a text input.  If not, what's presented
to the user is pretty clearly _not_ something they're going to be compelled to
fill in.  Which is the whole point, really.
